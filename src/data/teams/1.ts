    "Our web-based platform bridges the gap between Bhaktapur's rich cultural heritage and modern technology by empowering both locals and tourists. Locals can list their unique skills, activities, or products, while tourists and other users can discover, book, and learn from these experiences. Beyond connecting individuals, the platform supports local businesses, promotes cultural preservation, and fosters a sense of community. Join us in celebrating and sharing skills, traditions, and stories through a modern, user-friendly platform!",
